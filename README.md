# Study Buddy
Study Buddy is an AI-powered platform designed to help University of Waterloo students find the perfect study partners based on shared academic goals, learning styles, and course enrollment. By integrating Waterloo’s full course catalogue and sections, students input their goals, study preferences, and class schedules, allowing the AI model to match them with peers in the same courses. The app intelligently schedules study sessions based on users’ availability and preferred study locations, making collaboration seamless. Study Buddy also includes a gamified leaderboard, where users earn ratings—similar to Uber reviews—based on their effectiveness as study partners. The platform uses a database to store profiles, schedules, and ratings. While the prototype is tailored for the University of Waterloo, we aim to expand it to other schools, creating a universal academic collaboration tool.
